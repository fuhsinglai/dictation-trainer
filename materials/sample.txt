Welcome to the English Dictation Trainer. This page helps you practice listening and typing in English. First, select an article from the dropdown or paste your own text. Click Load to load the article. Each article is split into sections by blank lines. You can choose a section from the Section dropdown. The Play button speaks the current sentence. Press Alt plus R to hear the sentence again without using the mouse. Use Prev and Next to move between sentences.

You can play the entire section with the Play section button. Type what you hear in the box below. Click Check to see your accuracy. Turn on Strict mode if you want punctuation and capitalization to count. The Hide sentence option keeps the answer hidden so you practice by ear. You can upload new articles on the Upload materials page. The page remembers your last voice, article, and section when you return.
