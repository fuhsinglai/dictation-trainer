***This story is about** a boy named Ippo. Ippo was a high school student. He was very quiet and shy. He did not have any friends at school. He lived with his mother. They had a family fishing boat business. Ippo helped his mother every day. He woke up at 4:00 a.m., helped **carry** heavy **boxes of ice**, and helped clean the boats. His hands and legs were strong, but his heart was not. He went to school after work. His clothes often smelled like the sea. Other students did not like this smell. "He smells like fish," they **whispered**. Ippo heard them but just looked at the floor. Some boys **bullied** him—three boys. Their leader was a **tough bully**. They pushed him, **said mean things**, and took his money. "Give us your money, Ippo!" Ippo gave them his money. He was afraid. He never **fought back** and only said, "I'm sorry."*

        ***One day** Ippo was walking home when he saw the bullies under a bridge. "Hey, Ippo!" the bully shouted. **They cornered him**. "What is that smell?" one bully asked. "It smells like worms," said another. Ippo held a small bag. It was **fishing bait**. The bullies laughed. They hit him, pushed him to the ground, and **stepped on** the bait. "You are **disgusting**," the bully said. Then he said something terrible. He **insulted** Ippo's mother, saying, "Your mom must stink too." Ippo's body went cold. **Anger filled him, a hot, sharp feeling.** His hands **shook** because he wanted to hit them, but he did nothing, as he was too afraid. He could only cry.*

        ***Suddenly** a tall, strong man was there, wearing **running clothes**. "Hey," the man said to the bullies. The bullies turned. They were scared. They knew this man. His name was Takamura. "What are you doing to this kid?" Takamura asked. The bully tried to **act tough**. "**This is none of your business**." Takamura smiled. The bully tried to punch him. Takamura moved too fast. **In one second**, Takamura was behind them. He opened his hand. He was holding all their **shirt buttons**. "What?" The bullies **looked down**. Their shirts were open. They could not believe it. He was too fast. "Get out of here," Takamura said. The bullies **ran away** very fast. Takamura turned to Ippo, who was hurt, crying, and **dizzy**. Then he **fainted**.*

        *Ippo woke up in a new place. It was a **gym**. The gym was old. It smelled like **sweat** and **iron**. He heard sounds. The strong man Takamura was there. He was a professional boxer. "You are awake," Takamura said. Ippo sat up. He was still crying, feeling weak and **ashamed**. Takamura did not like this. "Stop crying. It's annoying." He went to a heavy bag. It was a big **canvas bag**. It was full of sand. Takamura drew a picture of the bully's face. He **taped** the picture to the heavy bag. "Hit this," Takamura said. "Let your **anger out**." Ippo looked at the bag. He was small. He looked weak. He hit the bag. The punch was soft. "That's not a punch," Takamura said. "Are you a girl? **Hit it harder**."* 

        *Takamura showed him. "Like this: **put your weight into it, from your legs to your hip, twist your body to your fist**." Ippo listened and tried again. He remembered the insults, thought about his mother, and all the times he ran away. He **pulled his arm back**. He shouted. He punched the bag with all his power. The sound was not a punch; it was an **explosion**. The whole gym became silent. The heavy bag **flew backwards**. The bag hit the wall. Takamura was silent, **his eyes wide**. He **stared at** Ippo, looking at his arm, **muscular** from **lifting ice**, and his legs, **thick** from the boat. This quiet, shy boy—he had the power of a heavyweight. Takamura smiled. He gave some videotapes. "Watch these," he said. "They are highlights of KOs. A KO means **knockout**. Go home, kid."*

        *Ippo went home. His hand hurt. His heart was **beating** fast. He watched the videos. He saw boxers who were fast and strong. He saw Mike Tyson. He was so powerful. He saw boxers **get knocked down**, but they **stood up** and **kept fighting**. Ippo watched all night. **He felt something new: hope**. He wanted to change. He wanted to be strong. He wanted to stand up. He wanted to know what strong feels like. The next day Ippo went back to the gym. "Please," Ippo said, "please teach me to box." Takamura looked at him. "You want to be a pro?" "It is not easy. I want to be strong," Ippo said. "I want to change."* 

        *Takamura took Ippo outside. They stood under a tree. "You think this is a game?" Takamura **kicked** the **tree trunk**. Many leaves started to fall. Takamura's hands moved. They moved too fast to see. He caught 10 leaves in his hand. "You have one week," Takamura said. "Catch 10 falling leaves at the same time. Do this and I will help you." Takamura walked away. He thought this was impossible. He wanted Ippo to quit. Ippo looked at the leaves. He kicked the tree. He tried. He caught one leaf. That was easy. He tried to catch two leaves. When he caught the second leaf, the first one fell. He tried again and failed. He practiced all day, but he could not catch two. He was frustrated. He cried, "This is impossible." But he did not quit. He practiced every day. He practiced in the morning before work and at night after work. He even practiced at school, drawing leaves on his notebook and practicing his jab, jab, jab, jab. His mother watched him. She saw him practicing in the yard. She did not understand, but she saw his eyes were focused.*

        ***For days**, he finally caught two leaves at the same time, then three, then five. He was getting faster, but 10 was still impossible. He was strong, but he was **stiff**. The final day arrived. Ippo was tired. His arms were heavy. He was practicing. He had to pass this test. He remembered Takamura's punch. He remembered the sound. It was sharp. His own punches were stiff. "Maybe I am too **tight**," he thought. Takamura looked relaxed. He relaxed his shoulders. He relaxed his fist. He did not punch at the leaves; he punched through them. He moved with his whole body. His hand was suddenly very fast. The sound was different. He called Takamura, "I am ready." Takamura came to the tree. He watched Ippo. Ippo stood under the tree, nervous. He took a deep breath. He relaxed. He kicked the tree. The leaves fell. Ippo's eyes were sharp. His hand moved. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. He did not stop. 8, 9, 10. He opened his hand: 10 leaves, all of them. **Takamura's jaw dropped**. He was shocked. "You did it," Takamura said. "You really did it! Now come with me."*

         *Takamura brought Ippo back to the gym. The old gym owner was there. His name was Kamogawa. He looked very **strict**. "Who is this boy?" Kamogawa asked. He looked at Ippo. Ippo **looked plain**. He looked weak. "This is the boy I told you about," Takamura said. "He looks weak," Kamogawa said. "No," Takamura said, "**I was not wrong about him**. This kid has guts." Kamogawa looked at Ippo. He was not **convinced**. "Guts are not enough," Kamogawa said. "We will test him now. **We see if he can take a punch.**" He pointed to another boy. "Fight him." The other boy was Miata. Miata was the same age as Ippo, a fast and **skillful** genius. His father was a great boxer.*

        *The practice match started. The bell rang. Ippo was nervous and **put his hands up**. Miata moved. His movement was beautiful. He **threw** two punches: **jab**, **cross**. Ippo was **knocked down**. "What? What happened?" Ippo thought. He stood up. Miata hit him again—a punch to the body. Ippo fell again, but he stood up again. "He is tough," Takamura said. Ippo was hit many times. He could not fight back, but he **kept standing up**. "Why doesn't he quit?" Miata thought. Ippo was learning. He **swung a big punch**, a wild punch. Miata **dodged**, but the punch hit his arm. Miata felt the power. "It was heavy. This guy, he has power," but Ippo was too **new**. Miata was too fast. Miata finished the match with a perfect punch. The match ended. Ippo lost the match, **covered in bruises**, but Kamogawa smiled. "This boy has guts." Ippo passed the test. Kamogawa decided to train Ippo. He saw Ippo's power. He saw Miata's skill. He wanted them to **compete**. "Competition makes fighters strong," Kamogawa thought.*

        *He trained Ippo for 3 months. Ippo **ran**, **lifted weights**, **skipped rope**, and **did push-ups**. He became stronger and faster. His body changed. Kamogawa planned a new match: Ippo **versus** Miata, a real rematch. The bell rang for Round One. Ippo was different—confident. He attacked, not scared. Miata was surprised. Ippo threw a heavy punch to the body. Miata **blocked** it, but it hurt. Ippo attacked again. He hit Miata with a heavy punch. Miata **fell down**. The gym was silent. Knocked down the genius! Miata stood up. He was angry. Ippo attacked again. He knocked Miata down a second time. Ippo wanted to finish it. He threw a big **uppercut**, but Miata was a genius. He saw the punch. **He threw a perfect counter.** It was a beautiful, terrible punch. It hit Ippo **right on the chin**. Ippo was **badly hurt**. His **legs shook**. The bell rang. Ippo was saved.*

        *"Ippo is an **infighter**," Kamogawa said. "**He must be close**. Miata is an **outboxer**. He uses distance and speed." Round Two. Miata was smart. He knew Ippo was dangerous, so he did not fight. He defended, moved, and **held** Ippo **in a clinch**. He **rested** until his breathing became normal. Ippo was still tired. He was frustrated. Round Three. Miata attacked using his **fast feet**. He hit Ippo with one, two, three punches. Ippo could not touch him. Ippo could not hit him. Miata was too fast. He hit Ippo with a clean punch. It was a **hard hit**. Ippo's world **went dark**. **He was on the floor.** **He was at his limit.** His body was broken, but his **spirit** was not. **He grabbed the ropes**. **He pulled himself up.** **He stood on shaking legs.** The round ended. Kamogawa looked at Ippo. His face was **swollen**. "Do you want to stop?" Kamogawa asked. "You will only get hurt." Ippo looked at Miata. Miata looked strong. "No," Ippo said, "I will not stop. I want to win."*

        *The Final Round. Ippo knew he had one chance. He defended, blocking Miata's punches. He walked forward, eating punches and waited. Miata attacked a combination of punches. Ippo saw it—a small opening. Ippo threw his last punch, all his power. Miata saw it. He threw his own **counter punch**. It was the same as Round One. Miata's punch **grazed** Ippo's chin. Ippo's punch missed, but then something strange happened. Miata **stumbled**. He fell. His body was frozen. The graze on his chin made his body freeze. Miata's mind was clear. He told his body to move. "Stand up!" he **screamed** in his head, but his legs would not **obey**. **He was a prisoner in his own body.** He could not stand. The referee counted 8, 9, 10. Ippo won! It was a lucky victory, but he won. Ippo was so tired that he fainted.*

        *Miata felt terrible. He **lost to** a beginner. That night, Miata left the gym. **He did not appear at the gym again**. After that practice match, Ippo trained hard. He also watched Takamura prepare for a big fight. Takamura was his **senpai**, **his senior**. Takamura's training was very hard. Ippo saw how Takamura **suffered to lose weight**. Takamura had to stop drinking water. He was always hungry and angry. Ippo visited Takamura's home. **It was late at night**. Takamura was in the dark. He was standing in front of his refrigerator. He was shaking. He wanted to open it to eat something, but he did not. He hid his own face. He **turned away from** the food. He started to practice punching in the air. Ippo watched from the **doorway**. He was **amazed**. This was a true professional. This was **mental strength**. Ippo was **inspired**.*

        ***On fight night**, Ippo was in the **crowd**. The bell rang. Takamura was powerful and fast. He knocked his **opponent** out in one round. **The crowd cheered**. Ippo felt the excitement. "I want to be there," he thought. "**I want to be on that stage**." As Ippo was leaving the **venue**, he saw Miata. Miata was waiting for him. "I have already left the Kamogawa gym," Miata said. Ippo was shocked. "What? Why?" "I cannot be in the same gym **as you**," Miata explained. "If we are in the same gym," Miata said, "we cannot fight each other as professionals. We will meet again in the **professional ring**, in the final match of the Rookie King tournament." Ippo now had a **rival**. He had a goal.*

        *Ippo had to get his professional license. He trained hard. He took the test. He passed. He was now a professional boxer. Ippo was walking home, holding his new license card. He was happy. The bullies found him again. "Hey, long time no see." Ippo was scared (old habits). His license card fell. The bully picked it up. "A pro boxer? You?" The bullies laughed. The bully tried to punch Ippo. Ippo did not move his body, only his head. The punch missed. The bully tried again, and Ippo **dodged**. His **footwork** was beautiful. He was not scared. He did not fight back. He just picked up his license and wiped it clean. He looked at the bully. "I have to go train." He walked away. The bullies were frozen. They were scared. Ippo was different.*

        *He was strong. He went back to the gym, **more focused than ever**. Soon Ippo's first professional fight was set. It was the East Japan Rookie King tournament. His opponent was a man named Oda. Ippo's friends at the gym talked. "Oda is easy," one said. "He is **arrogant**. He has no **stamina**." Ippo trained hard and did not listen. What Ippo did not know was that his friends were right. His opponent Oda was arrogant and did not train. His girlfriend was very angry. "You are lazy!" she shouted. "**You talk but you do not work**. I cannot watch you lose." Oda was **ashamed**. He was angry. He went back to the gym. **He trained like never before**. He trained for his girlfriend.*

        *The fight began. Oda was strong, not lazy. **He was motivated**. **They traded heavy punches**. Ippo hit Oda in the body. It was a good punch, and Oda fell down. But Oda stood up, fighting for his girlfriend. Oda threw a **wild punch**. It was not a clean hit. It hit Ippo near his eye. **It was a bad cut**. Blood **covered** Ippo's face. The **referee** stopped the fight. The doctor came. "This is bad," the doctor said. "If it **bleeds** more, I will stop the fight. You will lose." The fight continued. The Third Round started. Oda knew, so he attacked the cut—jab, jab, jab at the eye. Ippo could not see because blood was in his left eye. He was in trouble. "I will lose," Ippo thought. So Ippo did something crazy. He **switched** his feet. His right foot **was now forward**. This new **stance** protected his cut. Oda was confused but then attacked **harder**. "He has no power now. His best punch is gone." Oda **trapped** Ippo in the corner and **swung**, but Ippo's right hand was free. He threw a right jab that hit Oda. Then Ippo attacked a **storm of punches**. Oda could not defend and was knocked out. Ippo won his first pro fight.*

        *After the match, Oda and his girlfriend **were together**. "I'm sorry," Oda said. "You were amazing," she said. His coach smiled, "Let's start again." Ippo watched them. He was happy for his opponent, but he had to keep going. Ippo's second fight **was next**. Kamogawa **taught** Ippo a new defense. Ippo held his **gloves** high, close to his chin. This new defense was strong. His opponent was a **tricky man**. The fight started. Ippo's defense was perfect. The man could not hit him: **block**, **block**, **block**. The man became **desperate**. He **ran at** Ippo and hit him with his head. It was an **illegal foul**. Ippo was shocked, thinking it was an accident, but the man did it again. He hit Ippo's chin **with his head**. Ippo became **furious**. The man tried a third **headbutt**. **This time** Ippo did not move and **met the headbutt** with his own head. The man was hurt. Ippo was angry. "You fight dirty," Ippo thought. He threw an uppercut, a **massive** angry punch. The man was knocked out. Ippo won his second fight.*

        *He was now in the **next round of the tournament**. His opponent was Jason Osma, a very strong American soldier. He had a special hook, a **one-hit KO punch**. This was very dangerous for Ippo. Ippo was an infighter; he had to get close. Kamogawa had a plan: "You must learn to dodge this hook." He asked Takamura to help. Takamura was much bigger and stronger. **For days**, Takamura threw his hook at Ippo. Ippo was hit. He was hit again. It was **painful training**. Ippo also practiced at home. He found a **low bar** in a park. He practiced **ducking** under it. His body learned the movement. He learned how to duck under the dangerous punch. He was ready.*

        ***The night of the fight**, the bell rang. Ippo was fast, but Osma was also fast. Osma threw his hook. Ippo **ducked**. He **dodged** it. The training worked. But Osma was smart. He watched Ippo. He learned Ippo's **timing**. In the first round, Osma threw another hook. It was fast. **It was a terrible, strong punch**. Ippo was knocked down. The crowd was quiet. He was hurt. His vision was **blurry**. He saw a shape. It was a **distorted** old man. The old man was **shouting**, "Stand up, Ippo!" It was Kamogawa. "What happened?" Ippo thought. "My body. I remember I was knocked down." He heard a voice: "Five, six." It was the referee. Ippo **pushed himself up** from the floor. His legs felt like jelly. They would not stop shaking, but he was standing. Osma attacked, **wanting** to finish. Ippo was almost down again. He was hurt and scared. The bell rang. Ippo was saved. He sat in his corner. He was hurt. He was scared.*

        *The plan had failed. **His defense to dodge the hook** was not enough. What could he do? Kamogawa, the old man, **leaned in**. He did not have a new plan; **he had an order**. "You cannot dodge all his punches," the old man said. "He is fast. Your defense is not enough." Ippo was confused. "What do I do?" "You must hit him when he attacks! You attack! Hit him back! Hit him harder!" Kamogawa's eyes were **fierce**. "Make him afraid." Round Two. Osma threw a punch. Ippo did not dodge but hit Osma at the same time. Bam! They **traded** punches. Osma was surprised. Bam! They **traded** again. It was a war. Osma was strong, but Ippo was also strong. Ippo's eyes were not scared. He kept moving forward, kept punching. Osma felt something: this boy was not afraid. Osma **felt fear**. "Why isn't he falling?" Osma thought. He became desperate. Ippo saw it. He ducked under a punch. He threw a perfect punch to the body—**a liver blow**. Osma fell. He could not breathe. He was in **terrible pain**. As the referee counted six, seven, Osma **looked up**. He could not give up. He had a reason to fight. He thought about his poor gym. His friends were his family. An old woman **mended** the sandbags. They needed **prize money**. "I fight for them," he thought. With all his power, Osma stood up. **The crowd cheered**. He was a **warrior**.*

        *The fight continued. **Both men were at their limit**, **totally exhausted**. Their punches were slow. Osma knew he had one last chance. He threw his final, biggest hook. He put all his strength into it. This was his KO punch. Ippo did not think; his body just moved. He had practiced this **thousands of times**. **He ducked—a perfect, beautiful dodge.** Ippo was safe. Osma was open. Ippo threw his **final combination**. One, two, three punches hit Osma's chin. Osma fell and did not get up. The fight was over. Ippo was so tired he **fell to his knees** and cried. Ippo had won.*

        *He stood up and walked to Osma, who was sitting in his corner. Ippo **bowed**. "Thank you," Ippo said. "It was a great match." "I learned so much." Osma looked at Ippo. He was **bruised**, but he smiled. "You are strong, kid," Osma said. He **nodded at** Ippo. "You must win this whole tournament, get the Rookie King title." After he said this, Osma slowly stood up and walked away. Ippo watched his back. He felt the **weight of his opponent's expectation**. Ippo nodded to himself. He knew his journey was just beginning and new training was about to start.*
