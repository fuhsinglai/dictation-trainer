*Chihiro was a 10-year-old girl. She was a little weak, a little **spoiled** and **cried** often. You might not think she could be a hero, but this is the story of her journey and how this **ordinary girl** became one of the greatest heroes. Chihiro's family was moving to a new home and she hated it. "I don't want a new school," she complained to her mother. **She was close to tears**. She held flowers from her old friends. The flowers were starting to look weak and old. Her father drove the car very fast. He liked new places and new things. A small road went into a deep forest. The road was **bumpy** and old. Tall trees made the world feel dark. They stopped at a strange red building. It had a long dark tunnel in the middle. The front of the building looked like a face. Her father wanted to look inside. "It's an adventure," he said. Chihiro hid behind her mother. "It's scary." "I don't want to," she cried. Her parents did not listen. They walked into the darkness without her. Chihiro was afraid of being alone. "Don't leave me," she shouted and ran after them.*

        *Her small legs worked hard to catch up. The tunnel finally ended. They stepped into a beautiful green field. An empty town was in the middle of it. Warm light touched their faces. No people lived in this town. **Everything was quiet and still**. A wonderful smell came from a street. It was the smell of delicious food. Her father followed the smell with a happy smile. He found a restaurant with many dishes. The food was hot and ready. No one was there. The chairs were empty. Her father started to eat **right away**. Chihiro's mother joined him. Their faces were full of joy. The food was for the gods, but they did not know. The town was completely quiet. There were no birds and there was no wind. Hot food **sat on** the tables but there were no cooks. The empty quiet felt very wrong to Chihiro. **A deep worry grew in her stomach.** She said, "We should not eat this." Her parents did not listen. Their mouths were full of food. They only made happy eating sounds. The girl walked away from them. She wanted to explore the quiet town.*

        *A big tall bath house stood in the center. It looked very important. A long red bridge went to the bath house. She saw a boy on the bridge. He looked at her with great surprise. His dark eyes were very serious. He said, "You cannot be here. Go back now. You must leave before it gets dark." He seemed very worried for her. For a moment his eyes had a strange beautiful light. The sun was going down very fast. Long shadows grew on the empty streets. The long thin shadows made the town feel scary. Darkness came like a soft black **blanket**. Lights in the town suddenly turned on. They **glowed** with a warm strange color. **Spirits** and **strange creatures** started to appear. They were shadows at first. Then they became solid bodies. The quiet town was now full of life. It was a city of ghosts. Chihiro hid behind a wall, her **heartbeat** very fast. She ran back to her parents. The food was still on the table but her parents were not there. Two big pigs sat on the chairs. They wore her parents' clothes.*

        *The pigs ate the food with loud **greedy** noises. Her hands grew cold with **terror**. These pigs were her parents. She knew it. With a long loud **scream**, Chihiro ran away from the **horrible sight**. She went back to the green field. She had to escape this terrible world. But the field was not a field now. It had become a very big river. The water was deep and wide. There was no way to go back. Her old world was gone. A terrible feeling **came over** her. She looked at her small hands. They were becoming **see-through**. She was a human in a **world of spirits**. The world was **rejecting** her body. **A deep cold fear filled her stomach.** She thought, "Am I going to **vanish** forever?" She felt so small and lost. The boy from the bridge found her again in the shadows. He was calm and kind. "My name is Haku," he said softly. He looked at her sad face. "I know you from somewhere." He said to her, "You must eat something from this world." He gave her a small red berry. It felt warm in her hand. "If you do not eat, you will disappear." Chihiro was scared but she trusted his serious eyes.*

        *She ate the small berry. A warm feeling **spread** through her. Her body **became solid** again. She was safe for now. Haku held her hand. His hand was warm and strong. He **led** her through the busy spirit town. "You need a job to **survive** here," he explained. "Yubaba is the **witch** of this place. She controls the bath house." His words gave her a little bit of hope. "Yubaba turns lazy people into animals. You must work for her, then you can stay." He took her toward the **giant** bath house. They had to be very quiet. Haku showed her a hidden path. He told her about a man named Kamaji. He worked **deep down** in the **boiler room**. "Find Kamaji," Haku whispered. "Ask him for a job. He will say no at first, but you must not give up. You must show him you are strong." Chihiro went to the boiler room alone. It was hot and loud. An old man with six long arms worked there. This was Kamaji. He was very, very busy. Small black **soot spirits** carried heavy **coal** for him. They were small and cute.* 

        *One little spirit dropped its piece of coal. The coal was too heavy for its tiny body. The girl picked up the coal. It was surprisingly heavy. She carried it to the fire for the small spirit. Kamaji saw this action. He did not smile. "I have enough workers here," he said in a rough voice. Chihiro's hope became very small. Another soot spirit **stumbled**. Its coal fell to the floor. Before Kamaji could shout, Chihiro picked it up. She carried the heavy coal to the fire. Then she looked at Kamaji again. Her eyes said, "I can work." A woman came with food for Kamaji. Her name was Lynn. She was a spirit too. She looked at Chihiro **with unfriendly eyes**. Kamaji saw the girl's action. He told Lynn, "This girl wants a job. Take her to Yubaba." Lynn was not happy about it, but she followed Kamaji's order. She helped Shihiro. Lynn took her up many stairs. The bath house was huge inside. It was a city in one building. Finally, they reached the top floor. Yubaba's office was behind a big fancy door. The door had a scary face on it. Yubaba was a very scary old woman.*

        *She had a very large head and a small body. Her face was **full of deep wrinkles**. She smoked a long **cigarette**. "I want a job," Chihiro said. Her voice was small. Yubaba laughed a loud cold laugh. "A human girl? You are weak and useless here." The **witch** did not want her. She tried to scare Chihiro away with her magic. The air became heavy and cold. Suddenly a loud noise came from another room. A baby was crying very loudly. It was Yubaba's baby. The baby was huge, bigger than Yubaba. He threw his toys. The witch had to **calm** her baby **down**. She was very busy with the giant child. Chihiro saw her chance. She shouted, "Please give me a job! I will work very hard." Yubaba was **annoyed**. The baby was still crying. The witch needed to stop the terrible noise. "Fine," Yubaba shouted. "You can have a job, but you must give me your name." It was a magical contract. Yubaba took the name Chihiro from her. The letters floated into the witch's hand. She gave her a new name. Her new name was Sen. It was a small name for a small job. But **the price for this name** was bigger than she knew.*

        *The next day Haku found Sen. He took her to a **pig pen** behind the bath house. She saw her parents. They were still pigs. They did not remember her at all. **Sadness** was heavy in her heart. She cried quiet tears. "Don't eat too much," she whispered to them. "They will cook you." The pigs just made pig noises; they did not understand. Haku gave her something important. He had kept her old clothes safe after she started her job. It was the only thing she had from her world. Inside a pocket there was a card. Her friend had given it to her. The card said, "To Chihiro, I will miss you." Haku looked at her. "Yubaba controls you with your name," he said. "She took my name a long time ago. I cannot remember my real name now." He held her hand **gently**. "But I remember your name. It is Chihiro." Sen felt a little stronger. Her real name was a small light inside her. She had a secret now. She had to work very hard. Lynn showed her how to clean the big baths. The work was difficult and dirty.*

        *Other spirits were not friendly to her. She was a human. They thought she smelled bad. She ate her meals alone. Every day was long and hard. **One rainy evening** a strange guest arrived and he came for a bath. It was a spirit covered in **dark smelly mud**. He was very big and moved slowly. Everyone called him the stink spirit. No one wanted to help him. They ran away from the bad smell. Yubaba looked at Sen. The witch smiled. It was the kind of smile that enjoys seeing others in trouble. "Sen, you will wash this guest," the witch commanded. It was more than a command. It was a test. In this world a useless worker could easily disappear. The other workers laughed. Sen was afraid but she did her job. Her hands were shaking. She led the stink spirit to the biggest bathroom. The **mud** was deep and thick. He gave her a special ticket for the best soap. The water **poured into** the tub. It washed some of the mud away. Sen felt **something hard** in the spirit's **side**. It was like a big **thorn**. She **pulled on** it. The thorn was very big and stuck.*

        *Yubaba saw it. She realized this was not a stink spirit. "Everyone help her!" the witch shouted. All the workers **pulled on** the thorn together. They used a strong **rope**. With a huge pull it came out. It was an old **rusty** bicycle. Then more trash came out. Bottles and **old junk poured from** the spirit. The mud **washed away** completely. The spirit was not a stink spirit. He was a powerful river spirit. His face was like an old kind man. He had a long white **beard**. The river spirit was clean. He laughed a deep happy laugh. The sound filled the whole bath house. He gave Sen a special gift. It was a small **bitter** smelling ball of medicine. Then he **flew away** into the night sky. Gold dust fell from the sky. All the workers were happy. Yubaba was very happy. Sen had done a very good job. That night Sen had a bad dream. She dreamed about Haku. He was hurt and bleeding. When she woke up she saw something outside her window. A white dragon was flying in the sky. He was attacked by many small paper birds. The dragon was bleeding real blood.*

        *Sen knew it was Haku. He was a dragon spirit. The dragon flew into Yubaba's rooms. Sen followed him without thinking. Her only thought was to save Haku. She ran up the stairs to the top floor but the **hallways** were full of noise and **greedy** spirits. A strange guest stood in her path. It was No Face. **Earlier** Sen had seen him standing alone in the rain. She felt sorry for the quiet spirit so she **had left a door open for him**. He was now making gold from his hands. He **offered** Sen a lot of gold but her mind was only on Haku. "I have to go," she said. "I am busy." The spirit seemed sad and confused. He did not understand why she said no. Sen **pushed past the crowd**. She finally reached Yubaba's rooms. She found Haku. He was very hurt. Yubaba's giant baby was there. He wanted to play with Sen. He was very strong and lonely. She **managed to escape** from him. She saw Haku. He was close to a deep hole. Yubaba was not there. But Sen understood her **cruel rule**. A **servant** who failed and caused trouble was **thrown away**. The workers were ready to push him into the dark hole.*

        *Suddenly a paper bird **turned into** another person. The witch looked exactly like Yubaba. But the witch said, "I am Zaniba. I am Yubaba's twin sister." She was very angry. "That dragon stole my special golden seal." She said it is a seal that holds a witch's power. Zaniba's magic was powerful. She turned Yubaba's baby into a small mouse. She also turned a servant into a fake baby. The dragon used his **last bit of strength**. He hit the magic paper bird. Zaniba's image disappeared. The magic was broken but the dragon was **too weak to fly**. He had **no strength left**. He fell into the **deep hole below**. Sen and the little mouse held on to him and they fell together. Haku was still a dragon. He flew them out of the hole. They went to Kamaji's boiler room. Haku was very sick. The golden seal had a **powerful curse**. This dark magic was now inside Haku. It made him very sick from the inside. Sen remembered her gift. She had the medicine from the river spirit. She gave half of the medicine to Haku. The dragon coughed.*

        *It was a terrible sound. He **coughed up** the golden seal. He also coughed up a small **black slug**. Sen **stepped on** the slug with her foot. It was the curse. Haku was still very weak but the dark magic was gone. He **turned back into** his **boy form**. The curse was gone but the golden seal was still in Haku's hand. Sen looked at it and she finally understood everything. Yubaba had **forced** Haku to steal the seal. He was not a thief. He was only a servant **following a cruel order**. Sen knew this was not over. The seal's powerful owner was still angry. Sen knew what she had to do. She had to return the seal to Zaniba. It was the only way to **ask for forgiveness** and truly save Haku. She had to say sorry for Haku. Kamaji gave her special train tickets. He told her where Zaniba lived. It was a long journey. Before she left Lynn came to her. Lynn told her about No Face. The spirit was now a huge monster. He was eating the workers. Yubaba wanted Sen to stop him. Sen went to No Face. He was **enormous**. He had eaten many things.*

        *He offered her more gold and food. He wanted her to be happy. She did not want them. "My friends and parents are more important," she said. She gave him the last half of the medicine. The monster began to **throw up**. He threw up all the food and the people. He became very angry. He started to **chase** Sen. She ran to the train station. The monster followed her. He threw up everything. The angry monster disappeared. He became his small quiet self again. He was calm now. The train came. It moved on top of the quiet water. Sen got on the train. She let No Face come with her. The little mouse was with her too. The train moved across the big water. It was quiet on the train. **For the first time in a long time**, Sen could think. She thought about her parents. She thought about Haku. She was not the same crying girl from the tunnel. She had a mission now. And she was not afraid anymore. Haku woke up. He felt much better. He talked to Yubaba. "Your baby is gone," He said. "He is with Zaniba. I can bring your baby back." Yubaba was very worried about her baby.*

        *She loved him very much. Haku made a deal. "If I bring him back," he said, "you must let Chihiro and her parents go free." Yubaba agreed to the deal. She looked at Haku with her sharp eyes. She thought, "The girl will never pass my final test anyway." Sen, No Face, and the mouse reached Zaniba's house. It was a small cozy cottage. Zaniba was not scary like her sister. She was kind and warm. Sen **gave back** the golden seal. She said she was sorry. Zeniba was not angry. She had forgiven Haku already. **She invited them inside for tea**. **Over tea** Sen told Zaniba everything. She talked about Haku, her parents, and her stolen name. Zaniba listened with a kind face. She told Sen that magic cannot solve everything. She said that Sen's friends could help her. "Everything will be all right," she said with a smile. Soon Haku arrived. He was a beautiful white dragon again. He was healthy and strong. Zaniba was happy to see him. She told No Face he could stay with her. **He could be her helper**. No Face was happy. He had finally found a home.*

        *Haku **flew** Sen and the little mouse **back** to the bath house. They flew through the dark night sky. The wind was soft in Sans's hair. She held on to the dragon's back. The dragon flew strong and **gentle**. She felt completely safe, like she was **being carried and protected**. Suddenly this feeling **brought back** a very old and deep memory. She remembered a river from her childhood. She had **fallen into** a river when she was very young. The river had saved her life. Its name was the Kohaku River. She told this to the dragon. "Haku," she said. "Your real name is the Kohaku River." The dragon's body began to change. The **white scales** disappeared and the **shape of a boy appeared**. Tears were in his eyes. He remembered his name. He was free from Yubaba's control forever. His real name was Kohaku. "You saved me, Chihiro," he said. "And I saved you." They arrived at the bath house. Kohaku gave the baby mouse back to Yubaba. He changed back into the giant baby. Yubaba was very happy. She had to keep her promise.*

        *But she had one last test for Sen. All the workers gathered. Yubaba showed Sen a group of 12 pigs. "Your parents are in this group," the witch said. "Find them. If you are correct, you are free." Sen looked at the pigs very carefully. **They all looked a lot the same**. They were big and fat. She looked for a long quiet time. Then she had an answer. After working so hard in the spirit world she knew one thing. She knew the **smell of fear** and the **smell of greed**. These pigs only smelled of greed. She said it out loud, "My parents are not in this group." Yubaba was shocked. The magic contract paper in the air **broke into dust**. The magic was gone. "You are correct," Yubaba said. She was not happy about it, but Sen was free. The other spirits **cheered for her**. "Your parents will not remember anything," Kohaku said softly. "That is the rule for humans who eat the food of the spirits." He took her hand. He led her back to the green field. The town looked empty again. Her parents were waiting for her. They looked normal. They did not remember anything at all.*

        *"Where were you?" her mother asked. "We should go now. We are late." They walked back toward the dark tunnel. Kohaku stopped at the edge of the spirit world. "I have my name now," he said. "I am leaving Yubaba. I will go back to my world." He looked at Chihiro. His eyes were full of kindness. "We will meet again," he promised. Chihiro had to go. She did not want to leave him, but she had to. "Don't look back," Kohaku said. "If you look back, **it shows** you do not want to leave. You must show the world you are ready to go home." She walked through the tunnel with her parents. It was just a normal tunnel. Now when they **came out** their car was **covered in** leaves and dust. **A lot of time had passed.** Chihiro **looked back** for a moment. She could not see the red building anymore. It was all gone. But she was not the same **sad little girl**. She was brave and strong now. Fore speech.*
