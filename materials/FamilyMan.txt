***The story begins** at a busy airport in 1987. The departure hall was loud and crowded with travelers, but two young people stood still near the security gate **looking only at each other**. Jack Campbell was 22 years old; he was handsome, **ambitious**, and ready to start his life. **He was about to** get on a plane to London for an important banking internship. He believed this trip was the first step to a rich and successful future. **Standing next to him** was Kate, his college sweetheart. She was not smiling. She held his coat tightly, her knuckles turning white. While Jack saw a bright future, Kate felt a heavy sadness. She **begged** him not to go. She had a terrible feeling that if he left now, he would never truly return to her. Jack wanted to **comfort** her. He looked into her tearful eyes and spoke with total confidence. "I promise that our love will not change," Jack said. But Jack was young and blind. He did not know that he was lying. He kissed her **forehead**, **pulled his coat free**, and walked through the security gate **without looking back**.* 

*He **marched toward** his destiny, **unaware that** he was leaving his soul behind.*

***Thirteen years later**, on a freezing Christmas Eve in New York City, Jack Campbell stood at the window of his **penthouse** apartment. He was now the Wolf of Wall Street, a man who commanded billions of dollars with a single phone call. Below him, the city looked like a **board game**. Jack **took a sip** of his expensive whiskey; the liquid burned his throat **pleasantly**. He was 40 years old, **incredibly wealthy**, and completely alone. His apartment was a museum of success. "I have everything," Jack thought, listening to the silence of his empty home. He did not have a wife to **nag** him about the dishes. He did not have children to **scream** and break his expensive vases. He had total freedom. Yet, as he looked at **his reflection** in the dark glass, the eyes staring back seemed tired.*

***Earlier that day**, his secretary had told him that Kate had called. Jack had stared at the phone for a long time. Why now? Why after 13 years? Jack felt a sudden chill. **His hand shook slightly as he reached for the phone, but he stopped**. He did not return the call. He told himself he was too busy with the **massive** merger deal happening tomorrow, but **deep down** he knew the truth: he was afraid.*

***Needing to clear his head**, Jack decided to walk to the corner store to buy some **eggnog**. **The wind on the street** hit his face hard, but he enjoyed the pain; it made him feel alive. He entered a small grocery store. Inside, **the atmosphere was dangerously tense**. A young black man named Cash was shouting at the **clerk**. "Check the ticket again," Cash **yelled**, **slamming** his hand on the counter. "I know I won." "Get out!" the clerk **sneered**, rolling his eyes. "**You people** are always trying to cheat." The air in the room suddenly changed. Cash kicked a display of candy bars, **sending them flying across the floor**. Then he **reached into** his jacket pocket. Jack saw the heavy black shape of a gun. The clerk stopped breathing. The room went silent. Jack knew he **had to act**. He was a **dealmaker**, and this was just **another negotiation**.*

*"I will buy the ticket," Jack said, his voice calm. He **pulled out** his wallet and threw $200 on the counter. "Here, take the money, go home". Cash looked at Jack, confusion **replacing** the anger in his eyes. He took the money slowly. The clerk **sighed in relief**, **wiping sweat** from his forehead.*

*Jack and Cash **walked out** into the snowy street. The city was quiet, the falling snow **muffling** the sounds of traffic. "You didn't have to do that," Cash said, looking at the rich man in the $2,000 coat. "Why did you help me?" "I don't like trouble," Jack replied, checking his watch. "And I have everything I need." Cash laughed, a low strange sound that seemed to echo too long. He looked at Jack with **intense eyes**. "You think you have everything? You have no idea what you're missing, Jack." "I am fine," Jack said, turning to leave. "Remember," Cash called out, "**you brought this on yourself**. Merry Christmas."*

*Jack walked home, **annoyed** by the **strange encounter**. He went to his **massive bedroom** and lay down on his **expensive sheets**. He closed his eyes expecting a peaceful night. He did not know it was the last time he would sleep in that bed for a very long time.*

*When he opened his eyes the next morning, his world had **vanished**. The first thing he noticed was the smell. It wasn't the clean **scent** of expensive **detergent**; it was the warm smell of old milk and dog hair. The second thing he noticed was the weight on his **chest**. A large dog was **licking** his face. Jack screamed and pushed the animal away. "Jack, stop shouting!" a woman's voice **mumbled** from **beside him**. Jack froze. He turned his head slowly. There, **sleeping next to him**, was Kate. But this was not the young girl from the airport. This was a woman with **tired lines around her eyes** and gray hairs mixing with the brown. She wore an old oversized t-shirt. "Kate," Jack whispered, **his heart beating very fast against his ribs**.*

*Before she could answer, the door burst open. Two children, a boy and a girl, ran into the room and jumped onto the bed. "Daddy, wake up! It's Christmas!" they shouted, **bouncing on the mattress**. Jack **scrambled out** of bed, **falling onto** the floor. He looked around **in panic**. This was not his penthouse. This was a small, **cluttered** room with cheap wallpaper **peeling** in the corners. Clothes were thrown everywhere. He ran to the window. **Instead of** the tall buildings of Manhattan, he saw a **suburban** street in New Jersey **covered in** **gray slush**. "Where am I?" Jack yelled. Kate sat up, looking concerned. "Jack, are you okay? You look **pale**."*

*He ignored her and ran to the closet. Where were his Armani suits? Where were his Italian shoes? The closet was full of **flannel shirts** and **cheap denim jeans**. He **grabbed** a pair of pants and a heavy jacket, **dressing with** shaking hands. He had to get back to the city. He had a merger to close. He ran outside into the freezing air. He looked for his Ferrari. It was gone. **In the driveway** sat a **rusty** green minivan with a dent in the side door. "No, no, no," Jack muttered, pulling at his hair. He jumped into the minivan. The engine made a terrible **coughing** sound before starting.*

*Jack drove like a **madman**, **speeding toward** New York City. His hands **gripped** the **steering wheel** tightly. "This is a nightmare," he told himself. "I just need to wake up." He reached his office building in Manhattan an hour later. He ran to the security desk, **breathless and sweating**. "Let me in," Jack **demanded to** the guard he saw every day. "I'm late for the meeting." The guard looked at him with a blank expression. "Sir, you can't go up there. Do you have an appointment?" "It's me, Jack Campbell! I am the president of this company!" Jack screamed, **pointing at** the directory on the wall. But when he looked at the list of names, his name was missing. The president was **someone else**. Jack felt **dizzy**. He tried to run to the elevators, but the guards grabbed him and **threw** him **out** onto the sidewalk.*

*Jack stood on the cold **pavement**, **shivering** in his cheap jacket. He had no money, no ID, and no life. Suddenly, a red Ferrari **pulled up to the curb**. The window **rolled down**. It was Cash, the black man from the convenience store wearing one of Jack's expensive suits.*

*"I told you," Cash said, smiling mysteriously. "You brought this on yourself." "Give me my life back," Jack shouted, grabbing the car door. "What did you do to me?" "**This is a glimpse**, Jack," the man said softly. "**A glimpse of the life you could have had** if you didn't get on that plane 13 years ago. You have to learn the lesson". He **handed** Jack a small silver bicycle bell. "Welcome to the family, Jack". The Ferrari **roared away**, leaving Jack alone on the street.*

*He looked at the bell in his hand. His **stomach turned**. He realized he had **nowhere to go but** back to the house in New Jersey. The drive back was slow. Jack didn't even remember which house was his. He had to stop and ask a neighbor, a friendly man who was **shoveling** snow. "Hey Jack, Merry Christmas," the neighbor **waved**. "You look like you saw a ghost." "I feel like one," Jack **muttered**.*

*He walked into the house. Kate hugged him tightly, the smell of **vanilla** and **flour clinging** to her clothes. "I was so worried," she said, **kissing his cheek**. "The kids are waiting to open presents." Jack looked at her. She was beautiful in a natural way, but he felt **trapped**. He was a billionaire living in a small box.*

***The next few days** were a **disaster**. Jack didn't know where the coffee cups were. He didn't know how to turn on the TV. **Worst of all**, he didn't know how to change a **diaper**. "It's your turn," Kate said later that afternoon, handing him the baby. Jack held the baby **at arm's length**; a terrible smell filled the room. He carried the boy to the changing table, holding his breath. He tried to use **duct tape** to close the diaper because he couldn't figure out the tabs. Annie, his six-year-old daughter, watched him from the doorway. She had sharp, intelligent eyes. She **walked over** and **pulled on** his **sleeve**. "You aren't my daddy, are you?" she whispered. Jack froze. He looked down at the little girl. "What makes you say that?" "My daddy knows how to change a diaper," Annie said simply. "And he doesn't look at the house like **he's never seen it before**. Are you an **alien**?"*

*Jack **sighed**, feeling **relieved** that someone knew the truth. "Yes, I am an alien. I am **borrowing** your dad's body." Annie nodded. "Okay, I won't tell Mom, but you have to be nice to her. Welcome to Earth." With Annie's help, Jack began to learn his new life. He learned that in this world he was not a master of the universe; he was a **tire** salesman. He worked at a tire store owned by Kate's father. Monday morning, Jack stood in the tire shop, wearing a uniform with his name **stitched** on the pocket. The smell of **rubber** and **grease** was strong. He spent eight hours rolling heavy tires and listening to customers complain about prices. **His hands, which used to** sign million-dollar contracts, **were now covered in** black oil. "I hate this," Jack thought, **scrubbing** his hands in the dirty sink. "I am a genius; I shouldn't be selling tires".*

*That evening Kate took him to the local shopping mall. Jack **wandered into** a men's clothing store. He saw a gray suit on a **mannequin**. He touched the **fabric**, closing his eyes. It felt like his old life. "**It's $2,400**," Kate said, looking at the price tag **with wide eyes**. "I want it," Jack said. "Jack, are you crazy?" Kate laughed nervously. "That is three **mortgage payments**! We need to save for the kids' college fund." "I work hard," Jack **snapped**, his voice rising. "Why can't I have one nice thing? Why do we have to live like this?"*

*The smile on Kate's face disappeared. She looked hurt. "I didn't know you were so unhappy, Jack. I thought **I thought we were doing okay**". She walked away, her shoulders **slumped**. Jack stood alone with the suit, feeling a pain in his **chest**. It wasn't anger; it was **guilt**.*

*The next morning was their **wedding anniversary**. Jack, of course, had forgotten. He woke up to find Kate smiling at him, holding a gift box. "Happy anniversary," she whispered. Jack felt panic. "I—I didn't get you anything." "It's okay," she said softly. "Open mine".*

*Jack opened the box. Inside was a suit. It wasn't the expensive one from the mall; it was a cheaper brand, but he knew they couldn't **afford** even this. "I know it's not the Hugo Boss," Kate said, biting her lip. "But you looked so sad the other day. I wanted you to feel like yourself".*

*Jack **stared at** the suit. His throat felt tight. She had **sacrificed** her savings to make him smile. He looked at her, really looked at her, for the first time. She wasn't just a tired housewife; she was the woman who loved him more than money.*

*"I have a surprise for you, too," Jack lied quickly. "Get dressed, we are going into the city." He took her to a **fancy restaurant** in Manhattan, **the kind of place** he used to eat at every week. The waiter looked at their cheap clothes with **disdain**, but Jack **stared him down** until he gave them a table. Kate looked at the menu and **gasped**. "Jack, the wine is $800 a bottle." "We'll have the **house red**," Jack told the waiter.*

*They ate dinner, laughing and talking. Jack told her stories about the business world, **pretending** they were just dreams. Then the music started. Jack stood up and offered his hand. "Dance with me," he said. "There is no dance floor," Kate **giggled**. "There is now." He pulled her into the **aisle**. They danced slowly. Kate rested her head on his chest. Jack closed his eyes. He smelled her shampoo and the faint scent of vanilla. **For the first time in 13 years**, the **empty feeling in his chest** was gone. He felt warm.*

*Life began to improve. Jack stopped fighting the tire store and started using his brain. One afternoon a luxury car **pulled into** the shop with a **flat tire**. The driver was a famous banker Jack knew from his old life. Jack looked at the papers sitting on the banker's passenger seat. He recognized the deal immediately. "PC Holdings?" Jack asked, pointing at the papers. "Don't buy them." The banker stared at the **grease-covered mechanic** in shock. "Excuse me?" "Their **debt** is too high," Jack said, **wiping** his oily hands on a **rag**. "It is hidden in **shell companies**. Buy ARG instead; their stock will double in a month". The banker was impressed. He gave Jack his card. "Call me; **I need someone with your mind**".*

***This was it**—the **escape hatch**. Jack met with the banker the next day and **secured** a **high-level job offer**. It came with a **massive salary**, a signing bonus, and a luxury apartment in the city. **Jack rushed home, bursting with excitement.** He threw the **brochure** for the new apartment on the kitchen table. "Kate, **pack the bags**," he shouted. "We are moving back to New York! I got a job on Wall Street."*

*Kate looked at the brochure, then at Jack. She didn't look happy; she looked terrified. "Jack, we can't just leave," she said. "The kids have school, our friends are here, my dad needs you at the store." "But this is our chance!" Jack **argued**, **pacing** the small kitchen. "We can have money, we can have respect. Don't you want to be **admired**? Don't you want an easy life where you don't have to **clip coupons**?" "I am happy here," Kate said quietly. "How can you be happy?" Jack **gestured** at the **peeling wallpaper**. "Look at this place!"*

*Kate stood up, tears filling her eyes. She walked over to him and took his hands. Her palms were **rough** but warm. "Jack, I love you," she said, her voice shaking. Jack waited for her to continue. He saw the **fear in her eyes**. "If you really need this," she said slowly, "then I will go." She looked down at their joined hands. "I will take the kids away from the life they love. I will leave my home". Jack felt a sudden **pang of guilt**. "I will do that," she said, looking up at him again, "because I love you more than this house". "But remember, we are already rich," she pointed to the living room where the kids were playing. "We have two healthy children. We have each other. If we go there, we might have everything, but we might lose us. And I choose us."*

***Jack stood frozen.** He looked at the woman who was **willing** to give up her happiness just to support his dream. He looked at the refrigerator covered in **drawings his children made**. He realized that in his old life he had billions of dollars, but nobody would have given up a single thing for him. Here, he had nothing, but he was someone's whole world. "I," Jack started, but his voice **cracked**. He realized he didn't want the job, he didn't want the penthouse. He wanted to wake up in the **messy bed next to Kate**.*

***That night**, a strange feeling **settled over** him. He went to the kitchen to get some salt for dinner, but the shaker was empty. He felt sick to his stomach. He remembered the words of Cash: "A glimpse is temporary". He ran out the front door. The snow was falling heavily again. He ran all the way to the convenience store, breathing hard. Cash was there behind the counter **ringing up** a customer. "Don't send me back," Jack **begged**, holding on to the counter. "Please, I'm not ready." Cash looked at him with sad eyes. "You learned the lesson, Jack, but the glimpse is over". "I have kids," Jack shouted. "I have a wife who loves me. I can't leave them." "Keep the feeling," Cash said softly. "**That is the only thing you can take with you**".*

*Jack turned and ran back to the house. He **burst** into the children's room. Gently, he kissed Annie on her sleeping forehead and his baby son on his chubby **cheek**, trying to memorize the smell of their hair, the sound of their breathing. He ran into the master bedroom. Kate was asleep. He shook her shoulder **gently**. "Kate, wake up," he whispered, **tears streaming down** his face. She opened her eyes, sleepy and confused. "Jack, what's wrong?" "I need you to know," Jack said, gripping her hand tightly. "I need you to remember me like this—not the guy who wanted the suit, the guy who loves you, the guy who chooses us". "I know, Jack," she smiled sleepily. "I love you too. Now come to bed".*

*Jack sat in the chair beside the bed, refusing to close his eyes. He stared at her face, memorizing the curve of her nose, **the way** her **eyelashes** rested on her cheek. He wanted to stop time, but his eyes were too heavy. He **fought** it, but he fell asleep.*

*When he opened his eyes, the silence was terrible. The air was freezing, unlike the warm, **stuffy** bedroom in New Jersey. The **ceiling** was too high. Jack sat up, **gasping for air**. He touched the sheets; they were cold, **slippery silk**, not the **soft cotton** he had felt moments ago. "No," he whispered. He ran to the other side of the bed. It was empty. **Rushing** to the window, he looked out. **Manhattan sprawled below him, cold and far away**.*

*Jack threw on his clothes and ran to the elevator. Driving his Ferrari like a **maniac** to New Jersey, he finally found the house. The peeling paint was the same. The rusty minivan was gone. He **banged on** the door. "Kate! Annie!" A stranger opened the door, a man he had never seen. "Can I help you?" "Where is my wife?" Jack shouted. "Where are my kids?" "There is no Kate here," the man said, looking at Jack like he was crazy. "I've lived here for 5 years."*

*Jack **stumbled back** to his car. He fell onto the **hood**, **sobbing**. It was all gone: the warmth, the noise, the love. He was a billionaire again, and he was a **beggar**.*

*His phone rang. It was his secretary. "Mr. Campbell, the merger meeting is starting. Where are you?" Jack drove back to the city. He walked into the meeting room. Men in suits were shouting about billions of dollars. It all sounded like **nonsense** to Jack. He signed the papers **mechanically**. He saved the deal, but he felt empty inside.*

*Then he remembered: in his real life, Kate was a lawyer. He **ran out** of the meeting. He made a few calls and found her address. She lived in a townhouse in the city. He drove there, **his heart pounding**. He found her **surrounded** by moving boxes. She looked older than the girl at the airport, **sophisticated** and sharp. She was beautiful, but her eyes were cool. "Jack," she said, surprised. "What are you doing here?" "I just—I needed to see you," Jack **stammered**. "I'm moving to Paris tonight," Kate said, **taping up** a box. "I have a big job there." She **handed** him a small box. "I kept some of your things. You should take them." Jack took the box. He watched her work; **she was efficient, professional, and distant**. The Kate who made him fake suits and loved him in a messy house was gone. "Have a nice life, Jack," she said.*

*Jack walked out. He got into his Ferrari. He told the driver to take him to the office. He opened the box Kate had given him. Inside was a bottle of cheap **cologne** he used to wear in college. He opened it. **The smell hit him**. It was the smell of 1987. It was the **smell of hope**.*

*"Stop!" Jack yelled. "Forget the office! Go to the airport, the international terminal!" He ran through the terminal, just like he had 13 years ago, **dodging** travelers and jumping over luggage. The **loudspeaker** announced final boarding for Paris. He had to run faster. Finally, he found the gate. The **attendants** were closing the door. Kate was **handing over** her ticket.*

*"Kate!" Jack screamed, his voice **echoing** in the hall. She turned, **startled**. "Jack, what is wrong with you?" "Don't get on that plane," he said, **breathless**, **sweat running down** his face. "Jack, it's over," she said, her voice sad. "We made our choices."*

*"I saw us," Jack said, **stepping closer**. He didn't care that people were staring. "I saw our life," he said, trying to catch his breath. "We have a house in Jersey. It is messy. It smells like vanilla and dog hair, but it is ours". Kate stared at him, her mouth slightly open. "Annie plays the violin," Jack continued, his words **tumbling out** fast. "She is terrible at it, but she tries so hard. Our son has your eyes. He doesn't say **much, but he is smart**". "We have a mortgage, yes. We don't have money for expensive wine, but we are happy. Kate, I **swear** to you, **nothing has ever felt more real**". The airport announcement binged overhead: "Gate closed".*

*"If you get on that plane," Jack said, his voice breaking, "we will both be successful. We will have great careers, but we won't be us. We will never know what we could have been".*

*Kate looked at the gate, then she looked at Jack. She saw the **desperation** in his eyes. She saw the man she had fallen in love with before the money and the suits. "I need a coffee," she said softly. "But the airport coffee is terrible." **Jack let out a breath he felt he had been holding for 13 years**. He smiled, tears mixing with the sweat on his face. "I know a place," he said.*

*They turned away from the gate. They walked toward a small cafe with plastic chairs. Outside the window, the snow began to fall again, covering the world in white. They sat down, two cups of steaming coffee between them. It wasn't the house in New Jersey. It wasn't the family—not yet. But as Jack looked at Kate, he knew he had just made the best deal of his life. He had bought a glimpse of heaven, and he was going to spend the rest of his life earning it back.*
